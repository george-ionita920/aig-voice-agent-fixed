# AIG Voice Agent - Fixed

## NPM Dependency Issues Fixed

This repository contains the AIG Voice Agent system with resolved npm dependency synchronization issues.

### Issues Resolved

- **Package Lock Synchronization**: Fixed `npm ci` failures due to package.json and package-lock.json being out of sync
- **Missing Dependencies**: Resolved "Missing from lock file" errors for all dependencies
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Ensured all transitive dependencies are properly locked

### Original Error

The system was failing with errors like:
```
npm error `npm ci` can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json are in sync.
npm error Missing: dotenv@16.5.0 from lock file
npm error Missing: express@4.21.2 from lock file
npm error Missing: fastify@4.29.1 from lock file
... (and many more missing dependencies)
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/george-ionita920/aig-voice-agent-fixed.git
cd aig-voice-agent-fixed

# Install dependencies (now works without errors)
npm ci

# Run tests
npm test

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Start production server
npm start
```

### Dependencies

- **Runtime**: Node.js >=16.0.0, npm >=8.0.0
- **Main Dependencies**: fastify, express, ws, dotenv, uuid, node-cache, yaml
- **Dev Dependencies**: nodemon
- **Fastify Plugins**: @fastify/websocket, @fastify/cors

### Fix Details

The main issue was that the package-lock.json file was out of sync with package.json. This caused `npm ci` to fail with "Missing from lock file" errors for numerous dependencies including:

- Core dependencies: dotenv@16.5.0, express@4.21.2, fastify@4.29.1
- Utility packages: node-cache@5.1.2, uuid@9.0.1, ws@8.18.2, yaml@2.8.0
- Development tools: nodemon@3.1.10
- All transitive dependencies (150+ packages)

**Root Cause**: The package-lock.json file was corrupted or partially updated, causing a mismatch between declared dependencies in package.json and the locked versions.

**Solution Applied**:
1. Removed the corrupted package-lock.json file
2. Ran `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to regenerate the lock file with proper dependency resolution
3. Verified the fix with `npm ci` and `npm test`

### Commands Used to Fix

```bash
# Remove corrupted lock file
rm -f package-lock.json

# Regenerate lock file with proper dependency resolution
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Verify the fix works
npm ci  # Now works without errors
npm test  # Passes successfully
```

### Verification

After applying the fix:
- ✅ `npm ci` runs successfully without errors
- ✅ `npm test` passes with "All dependencies loaded successfully"
- ✅ All 154 packages are properly audited with 0 vulnerabilities
- ✅ Package-lock.json is properly synchronized with package.json
